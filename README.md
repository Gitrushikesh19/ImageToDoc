# ImageToDoc
It is a document automation system that transforms captured images or video frames containing text — such as content from whiteboards, instruction boards, or warehouse notice displays — into concise and structured documentation. It is mainly maintaining strong order of communication and having up to date task information. This system connects two modalities that is visual information and digital documentation, making communication smoother and reducing manual effort in transcribing or summarizing instructions.

# Problem statement and project implementation
In fast-paced environments such as warehouses, meeting rooms, or manufacturing facilities, instructions are often written or displayed on boards. These need to be manually noted, summarized, and circulated among team members — a repetitive and error-prone process.

ImgToDoc automates this by:
- Capturing the image/video frame containing text.
- Extracting readable text via OCR.
- Summarizing and structuring the extracted text.
- Generating a well-formatted Word document.
- Distributing the documentation automatically to the concerned recipients via email.

  # Improvements required
Handwritten Text Understanding: Improve OCR pipeline to accurately interpret handwritten board content.
Real-Time Notifications: Integrate with MicrosoftTeams, or WhatsApp for instant updates.
